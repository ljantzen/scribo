# Chapter 2: The Discovery

Two weeks had passed since Sarah found the letter, and she had spent every spare moment researching the Old Estate and her family's connection to it. The library where she worked had become her second home, and she had pulled every relevant book, document, and record she could find.

What she discovered was both fascinating and disturbing. The Old Estate had been the site of numerous significant events in her family's history—births, deaths, business deals, and, according to some sources, activities that were best left unmentioned in polite society.

But it was the discovery she made in an old newspaper archive that truly shocked her. Buried in a small article from 1952 was a mention of a fire at the estate, a fire that had claimed the life of someone whose name was suspiciously similar to one mentioned in her grandmother's letter.

Sarah sat back in her chair, the implications of what she had found washing over her. This wasn't just about family secrets—this was about something much darker, something that someone had gone to great lengths to cover up.

She knew she had to visit the Old Estate herself. The letter had mentioned specific rooms, specific hiding places where more information might be found. But she also knew that going there alone might be dangerous. Someone had been in that library recently—the documents on the table were proof of that. And if they were still watching, if they knew what Sarah was looking for, then her investigation might put her in danger.

But she had to know the truth. She had to understand what her grandmother had been trying to tell her, what secrets the Old Estate held. So she made her decision: she would visit the estate, and she would find the answers she was looking for, no matter what the cost.
