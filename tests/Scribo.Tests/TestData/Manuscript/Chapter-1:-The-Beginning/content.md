# Chapter 1: The Beginning

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, which Sarah would later come to see as significant. It was tucked inside a book her grandmother had left her—a first edition of a Victorian novel that Sarah had always admired but never read. The envelope was yellowed with age, the handwriting elegant but unfamiliar.

Sarah sat at her kitchen table, the morning light streaming through the window, and carefully opened the envelope. Inside was a single sheet of paper, the writing faded but still legible. As she read, her heart began to race. This wasn't just any letter—it was a confession, a secret that had been kept for decades.

The letter spoke of the Old Estate, of hidden rooms and buried truths. It mentioned names Sarah had heard in family stories but never fully understood. Most importantly, it contained a warning: some secrets were meant to stay buried, and those who sought to uncover them did so at their own peril.

But Sarah had never been one to shy away from a mystery. She folded the letter carefully and placed it back in the envelope, her mind already racing with questions. What had her grandmother known? Why had she kept this secret? And what would Sarah find if she followed the clues the letter contained?

She looked out the window at the quiet street, knowing that her life was about to change. The letter was just the beginning, and the Old Estate was waiting.
