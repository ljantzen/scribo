# Location: The Old Estate

## Description

The Old Estate is a sprawling Victorian mansion that has stood for over a century, though it has fallen into disrepair in recent decades. The house is surrounded by overgrown gardens and a wrought-iron fence that has rusted in places. Despite its neglected state, there's an undeniable grandeur to the architecture that speaks of a more prosperous past.

## Physical Details

The mansion has three stories, with a tower on the east side that offers a view of the surrounding countryside. The exterior is made of dark stone that has weathered over time, giving it a somber appearance. Many windows are boarded up, and ivy has claimed large portions of the walls.

Inside, the house retains much of its original character: high ceilings, ornate moldings, and grand staircases. However, dust covers everything, and some rooms show signs of water damage. The library, in particular, seems to have been preserved better than other parts of the house.

## Atmosphere

The estate has an eerie, melancholic atmosphere. There's a sense of history and secrets lingering in every room. The silence is profound, broken only by the creaking of old floorboards and the occasional sound of wind through broken windows. Visitors often report feeling watched, though whether this is due to the house's history or something more tangible remains unclear.

## Historical Significance

The estate was built in the late 1800s by a wealthy industrialist family. Over the years, it has passed through several owners, each leaving their mark. The house has been the site of numerous family gatherings, business meetings, and, according to local legend, some less savory activities that have been swept under the rug.

## Key Rooms

- **The Library**: Contains rare books and documents that may hold important clues
- **The Study**: Where important decisions were made, still contains old correspondence
- **The Attic**: Storage for family heirlooms and forgotten items
- **The Garden**: Overgrown but still beautiful, with hidden paths and a gazebo

## Current State

The estate is currently unoccupied and has been for several years. It's technically owned by a distant relative, but they have shown no interest in maintaining or selling it. The local community regards it with a mixture of curiosity and superstition, and few people venture near it after dark.
